# project_1
1st project for UCI Data Bootcamp

For this project we analyzed datasets from the gaming industry. We used two datasets on kaggle, Game Sale Dataset and Top Twitch Game Datasets.
We analyzed from the combination of these two datasets as well as the game sale dataset.
First we performed some basic analysis onto both datasets, such as finding the most populat game in both datasets.
We then plotted scatter plots of game sales vs everything to find correlations.

We first worked on Game Sale datasets, we found the most popular platform, genre, publisher and game within the dataset.
Furthermore, we found low correlation between game sales vs user/critics rating but high correlation between NA game sales vs global game sales.

For the second part of our analysis, we looked at the combined dataset and first looked at interesting data such as the most popular game on twich over time, the most viewed game on twitch and the most streamed game on twich. We also found a low correlation between game sales vs twitch viewers and game sales vs twitch channel counts. However, there is a strong correlation between average twitch viewers vs. average twitch streamers.

We have done more analysis within our code, however due to time limit of our presentation we cannot display everything such as the increase of Japanese and European publishers over time and how it affected sales within North America

In our analysis, we explored the relationship between video game sales vs twitch numbers and game ratings.
