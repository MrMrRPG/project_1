# project_1
1st project for UCI Data Bootcamp

For this project we analyzed datasets from the gaming industry. We used two datasets on kaggle, Game Sale Dataset and Top Twitch Game Datasets.
We analyzed from the combination of these two datasets as well as the game sale dataset.
First we performed some basic analysis onto both datasets, such as finding the most populat game in both datasets.
We then plotted scatter plots of game sales vs everything to find correlations.

In our analysis, we explored the relationship between video game sales vs twitch numbers and game ratings.
